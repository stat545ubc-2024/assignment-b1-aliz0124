# `check_outliers()` - Ali Zaidi

## Description
This is the associated repository for my created R function in STAT 545B assignment B1. Below is a description of the function `check_outliers()` from the function documentation:  

> This function checks for outlier values in a numeric vector based on either the Z-score method or the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. It returns a numeric vector containing the detected outliers, or an empty numeric vector with a message if no outliers were found or an error occurred. It provides flexibility in defining thresholds for outliers and the type of algorithm for calculating quartiles."

## Files included
This repository contains an [.Rmd](assignment-b1.Rmd) file and the associated [.md](assignment-b1.md) file that demonstrate the process of creating and documenting a function, showcasing examples, and conducting tests for `check_outliers()`.
